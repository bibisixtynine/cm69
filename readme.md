# Codemirror6

This code demonstrate a Codemirror6 with Safari iOS/iPadOS text selection bug :

1) Try to select the 12345678901 number by double-tapping on it : the selection works, but the options menu 'cut-copy-find...' doesn't appear.

2) Then supress (line 1) or (line 2) or just (the last '1' digit of the number), touble-tap again : this time it's OK and the options menu is there.
